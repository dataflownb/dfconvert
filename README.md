# dfconvert

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/dfconvert.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/dfconvert)

This library allows the conversion of Dataflow notebooks into their IPykernel equivalents. There is no guarantee made that the Notebook that enters will be as efficient as the notebook in the Dfkernel but it will perform in the same way.

A topological sort if also applied to the Notebook to ensure that it can be ran top down.

It relies on IPython core methods for some of the translation process so some magic and system commands may be translated into their IPython equivalent.

## Installation Instructions

1. cd to outer `dfconvert` that contains `setup.py`.
2. `pip install .`


### Usage
Upon installing the package, users will gain the capability to export their DataFlow notebooks as IPython kernel notebooks. This functionality can be accessed within Jupyter Lab by following these steps:

1. Open your DataFlow notebook in Jupyter Lab.
2. Click on the "File" menu located in the top navigation bar.
3. Navigate to "Save and Export Notebook As".
4. From the options presented, select "Ipykernel notebook".

This process allows users to save their DataFlow notebooks in a format compatible with IPython kernel, facilitating further analysis or sharing with others who may prefer or require this format.

Optionally the package can also be called by the use of
```
from dfconvert.export import convert_dfnotebook
file_name = 'mynotebook.ipynb'
nb = nbformat.read(file_name,nbformat.NO_CONVERT)
new_file_name = 'mynewnotebook.ipynb'
convert_dfnotebook(nb, in_fname=file_name, out_fname=new_file_name, md_above=False, full_transform=False, out_mode=False)
```

This will create a notebook with `out_fname` as an ipykernel compatible notebook if `out_fname` is not set then a file will be created with `file_name` that includes a `_ipy` before the extension to ensure that files do not become overwritten. `md_above` is a flag for marking markdown cells at the top of the notebook and sending the `full_transform` flag set to true will also convert all `Out[aaaaaa]` style references including those that are inside of comments and inside of strings, by default this set to off. `out_mode` is an additional flag that will make sure that if a cell has any output that is normally created in the dfkernel that this output will be shown in a new cell in the `ipykernel`, this will be repeated for all results found in a tuple.
